## Correlation Matrix
This model tracks the evolving relationship structure across macro assets, equity sectors, commodities, currencies, and crypto. It combines rolling correlation, beta statistics, and volatility-adjusted dispersion metrics to reveal when assets are moving together â€” and when they begin to decouple, posing either risk or opportunity.

- Visualizes pairwise linear relationships across 30+ assets.
- Color-coded heatmap instantly reveals high-correlation clusters vs. decorrelated outliers.
- Correlation shifts serve as a risk-on / risk-off sentiment gauge, useful for allocation and hedging.

## Beta Grid & Time-Series Engine

This Model computes beta vs SPY for each asset, alongside rolling average and percentile ranks.
It Displays how sensitive an asset is to the equity market, helping identify leading/lagging exposure.

### The Purpose:

- Detects structural breaks in asset relationships using time-based thresholds.
- Visual overlays on the SPY price chart show periods where correlation or beta exceeded key thresholds.
- Helps identify when diversification breaks down, and when hedges may become ineffective.
